# Publishing Checklist for Thai Profanity Filter

## Pre-Publishing Steps

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Package.json configured for publishing (v2.0.0)
- [x] TypeScript compilation working
- [x] All lint errors fixed
- [x] LICENSE file created (MIT)
- [x] .gitignore and .npmignore configured
- [x] README.md updated with installation instructions
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines created
- [x] CHANGELOG.md with version history
- [x] GitHub workflows for CI/CD created
- [x] Example usage files created
- [x] Ignore list functionality implemented and tested

### ⚠️ Needs Attention
- [ ] **Test suite compatibility** - Some tests fail due to language detection changes
- [ ] Update repository URLs in package.json (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
- [ ] Add author information in package.json

## Test Issues to Address

The language detection integration has changed some behavior:

1. **Karaoke Detection**: Now more restrictive due to language-first filtering
2. **False Positives**: Reduced (good) but some tests expect old behavior
3. **Performance Tests**: May need threshold adjustments

## Publishing Steps

### 1. Fix Repository Information
```bash
# Update package.json with actual GitHub username
sed -i 's/YOUR_USERNAME/actual-username/g' package.json
```

### 2. Update Author Information
```json
"author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
```

### 3. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Thai Profanity Filter v2.0.0 with language detection"
```

### 4. Create GitHub Repository
- Create repository on GitHub
- Add remote origin
- Push code

### 5. Test Locally
```bash
npm pack
# Test the .tgz file in another project
```

### 6. Publish to NPM
```bash
npm login
npm publish
```

### 7. Create GitHub Release
- Tag version v2.0.0
- Create release with CHANGELOG content
- Upload package assets

## Post-Publishing

### Monitor
- [ ] NPM package page
- [ ] Download statistics
- [ ] Issue reports
- [ ] Community feedback

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README badges
- [ ] Add usage examples to GitHub
- [ ] Consider creating wiki

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:
```bash
npm unpublish thai-profanity-filter@2.0.0 --force
```
(Only possible within 24 hours)

## Quality Gates

Before publishing, ensure:
- [ ] All critical tests pass
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities (npm audit)
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct
- [ ] Examples work as expected
- [ ] Documentation is accurate

## Success Criteria

Publishing is successful when:
- ✅ Package installs correctly via npm
- ✅ TypeScript types work in consuming projects
- ✅ Core functionality (ignore list, language detection) works
- ✅ Examples run without errors
- ✅ No critical security issues
